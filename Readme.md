### Step one, set initial project

Using expo I setup a blank project.

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

```
expo init "Project-Name"
```

### Step two, adding folder structure and thinking base react-native app structure for the project

Navigation, will hold the router, native router, for managing the rooting.
Screens, will hold the base views, for the two main views. (Login and Home).
Components, components will hold basic components if there is a need for that.
Styles, styles folder will hold the different styling architecture.
